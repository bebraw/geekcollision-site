The <a href="http://www.geekcollision.org/2012/04/so-meetup-on-284-sat-1400-at-hubjkl.html">SO meetup held at 28.4</a> was quite an interesting event. Seven of us gathered at the cosy premises of <a href="http://hubjkl.wordpress.com/">Hub Jkl</a>. We had a five talks ranging from graphical notations to web development. The sessions were quite lively and sparked conversation. It is likely we'll arrange another similar event later on May.<br /><br /><h2> Presentations</h2><br />Tero Tilus talked about graphical notations. Did you know that UML uses only one visual dimension? I didn't. I'll never look at maps the same. The slides of the presentation aren't available yet but they might appear here should there be demand.<br /><br />I gave three presentations. A longer one and two short ones. In the first short one I talked about two tools I've developed recently: <a href="https://github.com/bebraw/suite.js">suite.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bebraw/generators.js">generators.js</a>. The presentation, originally intended to be five minutes long, sparked some interesting conversation. As a result I have some idea how to develop the tools further. You can study the slides below:<br /><br /><div id="__ss_12732528" style="width: 425px;"><strong style="display: block; margin: 12px 0 4px;"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bebraw/suitejs-and-generatorsjs-rock-m" target="_blank" title="Suite.js and generators.js rock \m/">Suite.js and generators.js rock \m/</a></strong> <iframe frameborder="0" height="355" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/12732528" width="425"></iframe> <br /><div style="padding: 5px 0 12px;">View more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/" target="_blank">presentations</a> from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bebraw" target="_blank">Juho Vepsäläinen</a> </div></div><br />My second presentation was about static websites. During the last few months or so I've developed a few so I thought to share some of my findings. Even though the technology is quite old school, it's still relevant. The primary advantage of static is that it's very easy to serve. Just dump the HTML to some web server and off you go. Examine the slides for further details:<br /><br /><div id="__ss_12732659" style="width: 425px;"><strong style="display: block; margin: 12px 0 4px;"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bebraw/static-websites-the-final-frontier" target="_blank" title="Static Websites - The Final Frontier">Static Websites - The Final Frontier</a></strong> <iframe frameborder="0" height="355" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/12732659" width="425"></iframe> <br /><div style="padding: 5px 0 12px;">View more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/" target="_blank">presentations</a> from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bebraw" target="_blank">Juho Vepsäläinen</a> </div></div><br />My third presentation discussed <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a> CSS frameworks briefly. In this presentation I primarily wanted to motivate people to give either of these a go. They make a remarkable difference for a casual developer. There is no need to build it all by hand. Instead you can pick a framework and get something cool done without having to spend entire month on it. The slides are available below:<br /><br /><div id="__ss_12732694" style="width: 425px;"><strong style="display: block; margin: 12px 0 4px;"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bebraw/bootstrap-vs-skeleton" target="_blank" title="Bootstrap vs. Skeleton">Bootstrap vs. Skeleton</a></strong> <iframe frameborder="0" height="355" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/12732694" width="425"></iframe> <br /><div style="padding: 5px 0 12px;">View more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/" target="_blank">presentations</a> from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bebraw" target="_blank">Juho Vepsäläinen</a> </div></div><br />Last but not least Tsuri Kamppuri discussed about a MVC framework he built using PHP. Man, I'm so happy I don't have to work with PHP anymore. Anyway, it was nice to see what you can do with it if you really want to.<br /><br /><h2> Conclusion</h2><div><br />Overall I think that the event was a success. Sure, it might have been fun to have more people around but I feel everyone got something out of it. It is likely we'll arrange another one later on May. This time we'll make sure to let people know of the event earlier so it's easier to make room for it in the calendar.</div><div><br /></div><div>A couple of persons have already announced that they might have some topics to discuss about. I'm particularly excited about a certain design related prospect. It's more than fine to have less nerdy talks amongst the more nerdy ones.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3888915631085608984-3756365890304164826?l=www.geekcollision.org' alt='' /></div>
