This time we are going to have Stack Overflow themed collision. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/stackoverflow/">Apparently geeks around the world will gather</a> on 28th so why not to join them. The event will be organized at the premises of <a href="http://hubjkl.wordpress.com/">HubJkl</a>&nbsp;(Gummeruksenkatu 9 B 10) and will begin at 2 PM. See the map below for exact location:<br /><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><iframe frameborder="0" height="350" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=gummeruksenkatu+9&amp;aq=&amp;sll=62.309809,25.734612&amp;sspn=0.024768,0.042057&amp;t=v&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Gummeruksenkatu+9,+Jyv%C3%A4skyl%C3%A4,+Finland&amp;z=14&amp;ll=62.240051,25.743099&amp;output=embed" width="425"></iframe><br /><small><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=embed&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=gummeruksenkatu+9&amp;aq=&amp;sll=62.309809,25.734612&amp;sspn=0.024768,0.042057&amp;t=v&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Gummeruksenkatu+9,+Jyv%C3%A4skyl%C3%A4,+Finland&amp;z=14&amp;ll=62.240051,25.743099" style="color: blue; text-align: left;">View Larger Map</a></small><br /><br />After enjoying/suffering through a few presentations, we'll head towards the good ol' green. If you have done something interesting lately, be sure to prepare a talk. The program hasn't been fixed entirely so there's room for those.<br /><br />Just so you know what to await for, we'll be having talks at least about graphical notations in information systems and something about <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.<br /><br />See you there! If you are coming, please let us know by adding yourself to our <a href="http://www.doodle.com/9zr7yqtph6yhavxd">Doodle</a>. You might also bring your laptop if you happen to own one. Probably doesn't hurt unless it's one of those luggable ones.<br /><br />Big thanks to the fine people of <a href="http://hubjkl.wordpress.com/">HubJkl</a> for making this event possible.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3888915631085608984-483419007170869579?l=www.geekcollision.org' alt='' /></div>
