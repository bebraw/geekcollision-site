Yay! Yet another Geek Collision is coming up. Cast your dates <a href="http://www.doodle.com/eng6nybv89c3gwws">here</a>.<br /><br />Often people ask how get notified about these events. So here's a list. This will also work as a checklist for me and others arranging Geek Collisions. So please bug me or anyone else arranging Geek Collision if some media gets forgotten.<br /><br /><ol><li>First and the most official one is this blog</li><li>Second and probably most hardest to miss is our mailing list <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=fi#!forum/geekcollision">geekcollision@googlegroups.com</a>.&nbsp;It's not currently public list, but anyone is free to join. The list can be used by you too. For example <a href="http://www.geekcollision.org/p/recruiting.html">recruiting</a>.</li><li>IRC channel #geekcollision @ IRCnet. This is our most active media. GC announcement will most likely come out here first</li><li><a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=geekcollision.org_b44oicjnqd4oomoof49gnqjurc%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Europe/Helsinki">Google Calendar</a>. Get notified on Android and others.</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/geekcollision">@geekcollision</a> on Twitter. All blog posts will be automatically posted here using <a href="http://twitterfeed.com/">Twitter Feed</a>. It might get also some other random geek tweets.</li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Geek-collision/186196778097119">Facebook page</a>. All tweets get redirected here. Like it if you want to see the updates on your Facebook feed.</li></ol><div>Phew!
