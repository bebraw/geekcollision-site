This time we are in luck: We where generously given a Sauna rental by cedx! The sauna is on next Tuesday &nbsp;29.11 starting after 18:00. The sauna is <a href="http://www.jklcitysauna.fi/">Jyväskylän City Sauna</a>.<br /><br />Also people have asked for lighting talk session &nbsp;and this is a great opportunity to do that as well!<br /><br />This &nbsp;comes quite quickly, but there is no reason to stress about if you want to present something. The topics can be anything geeky and they don't have to be long. You can just talk about your pet project for one minute or pitch your favorite programming language for ten minutes. Anything goes! You can read more about Lightning talks from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Talk">Wikipedia</a>.<br /><br />Leave a comment if you want to do a talk so we can prepare for it.<br /><br />After the talks we can after match the topics until 4.0am. The venue has a flat screen for presenting purposes. I will bring a laptop which can be used with it. City Sauna provides towels for us. You can bring your own sauna drinks with you. You can also throw one for cedx for providing this sauna greatness for us for free :)<br /><br />The sauna has limited space so rspv in this doodle if you are coming:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.doodle.com/dhnap264fkmeaacq">http://www.doodle.com/dhnap264fkmeaacq</a> first come first served.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3888915631085608984-8349943770377462811?l=www.geekcollision.org' alt='' /></div>
